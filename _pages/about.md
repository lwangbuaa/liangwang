Liang Wang, Ph.D.

======

I am an Associate Professor in the [School of Computer Science and Engineering at Beihang University (BUAA)](https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/English/Home.htm), working in the Institute of Computer Architecture. I received my Ph.D. from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). During my doctoral studies, I was supervised by Prof. Terrence Mak and Prof. Ho-fung Leung. Following my Ph.D., I conducted postdoctoral research at Tsinghua University under the mentorship of Prof. Leibo Liu.

My research area mainly lies in computer architecture, with a strong focus on AI accelerator, on-chip/chiplet interconnects, GPU architectures and hardware acceleration. I have authored or co-authored over 30 high-impact papers as first or corresponding author in top-tier journals such as IEEE Transactions (e.g., IEEE TC, IEEE TPDS, IEEE TCAD) and top-tier international conferences in computer architecture (e.g., ISCA, MICO, HPCA, DAC).
